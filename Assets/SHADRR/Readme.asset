    text: SHADRR Library is a package meant to democratize shader usage in Unity.
      The easiest way to describe it is like a "Netflix of shaders", where you can
      scroll through a catalog of ready-to-use shaders and drop them in your project.The
      package is made for the Universal Render Pipeline but support for HDRP will
      come as a future update.

    text: 'Note: This is a project currently in development, so some of the shaders
      mentioned above may not be in the package yet. You can follow the development
      checking the Change log or taking a peek in our public Trello. You can use
      the assets in your games and projects, all I ask is that you do not re-sell
      or distribute these files.'
